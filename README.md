# Shaders

A bunch of interesting shaders.  Use at your own risk.


## Installation

Simply copy the `.shader` file of your choice into your Unity project.

Note that many of these will use
[Thry's Editor](https://github.com/Thryrallo/ThryEditor) - if you don't already
have that provided by another shader package (such as
[Poiyomi](https://poiyomi.com)), you'll need to also install that.
